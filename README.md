# Advanced DTP plugin for Photoshop

The script helps to draw eyelets on the graphic using many custom options.
Some of the options include:

#adding name of the file on graphic
#adding weld
#generating information about eyelets' placement

The script will be mainly used to prepare banners and other big prints that need to mounted using eyelets.
Drawing eyelets on the graphic helps to speed up production workflow.

Usage:
Play the script from menu using File - > Automation - > Script in Photoshop.
If you're gonna be using script frequently, I recommend recording this as an action and binding appropiate key.

Credits:
The script is using Layers.js library - https://github.com/darkwark/Photoshop to speed up drawing circles.
